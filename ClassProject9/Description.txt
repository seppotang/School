Class Programming Project 11
Write a program called RetailItem that holds data about an item in a retail store. The class should have the following fields:
•	description. The description field references a String object that holds a brief description of the item.
•	unitsOnHand.  The unitsOnHand field is an int variable that holds the number of units currently in inventory.
•	price. The price field is a double that holds the item’s retail price.
Write a constructor that accepts arguments for each field.  You will need a few other methods
•	sellItem.  This method takes an int parameter to decrement the unitsOnHand, and return the double  amount of the sales transaction 
•	print.  Accepts a String name of the item, and prints the fields for the item.
•	setDesc. Sets the description for the item.
•	reStock. Accepts a parameter for the amount to increase unitsOnHand by.
Your main method should have these calls:
        RetailItem Item1=new RetailItem("Jackex",12,59.95);
        Item1.setDesc("Jacket");
        System.out.println("Amount:$"+Item1.sellItem(2) );
        System.out.println("Amount:$"+Item1.sellItem(20) );
        RetailItem Item2=new RetailItem("Designer Jeans",40,34.95);
        RetailItem Item3=new RetailItem("Shirt",20,24.95);
        Item3.reStock(5);
        System.out.printf("%6s %-16s %5s %5s\n","Name","Description","Units","Price");
        Item1.print("Item1");
        Item2.print("Item2");
        Item3.print("Item3");

And produces this output:
Selling 2 Jacket
Amount:$119.9
Selling 10 Jacket
Amount:$599.5
 Name Description      Units Price
 Item1 Jacket                        0 59.95
 Item2 Designer Jeans      40 34.95
 Item3 Shirt                         25 24.95
